# KeyCap

Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/nhmkdev/KeyCap/releases/latest)

## Description
*Windows only* application for capturing keyboard input and remapping it to:
* another key or sequence of keys
* mouse input
* nothing at all
* on/off toggles for keys and inputs (this allows a single keystroke to initiate a hold and a second keystroke to end the hold)
* Repetition (with custom delay)

## Example Uses
* (original inspiration) Shortcutting a sequence of shortcuts. I originally created the application long ago to help with a sequence of keyboard shortcuts necessary to perform file merges when integrating a branch with [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/) + [Araxis Merge](https://www.araxis.com/)
* [Starbound](http://playstarbound.com/) Keyboard shortcuts to toggle off/on mouse buttons. This makes extensive mining in the game a lot less painful. [Mass Effect 2](http://masseffect.bioware.com/me2/) planet scanning also can be a lot easier...
* [Dreamfall Chapters](http://redthreadgames.com/games/chapters/) has a run button though it can be nice to have a button that toggles whether you are running or not instead of holding one down.
* [Citadel: Forged With Fire](https://www.citadelthegame.com/) has a number of long mouse hold actions. Toggling this off/on instead of holding the button for long periods of time is extremely nice.

## Run on Startup

With Registry Editor, add a new StringValue to `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` with the full path to `KeyCap.exe` followed by the full path to your `.kfg` file.  KeyCap will load the config file, start it and then minimize to the tray.

Alternatively, copy the following to a text file named `KeyCap.reg` and then edit it to match your setup.  Save it, right click-it and selct **Merge**.  Follow the prompts and then the next time you reboot, KeyCap will start automatically.

```regedit
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]
"KeyCap"="D:\\Util\\KeyCap\\KeyCap.exe -f D:\\Util\\KeyCap\\Config.kfg"
```

You can also include the `-autostart` argument if you wish to immediately start capturing keys with the loaded config.

## Warning
This program does perform keyboard capture and is essentially the first component of a key logger. I humbly request you NOT use the information included in the source code to create a malicious application.

## Visual Studio Notes
* If you attempt to run from Visual Studio you will need to make sure the C# project is configured with *Enable Native Code Debugging*. If this is not enabled the dll will not create the necessary keyboard hook (works fine outside of Visual Studio). This was observed in every Visual Studio version up-to and including 2015.

## Technical Documentation

### Library File Naming and Organization

* configfile - files related to reading the .kfg file format
* inputproc - files related to interpreting key inputs
* inputsender - files related to sending key inputs (remapped from those cpatured in inputproc)
* keycap - entry point and general functionality

### .kfg File Format

The file is prefixed with two 32-bit ints:

| File Data Prefix | File Format Version |
| --- | --- |
| 0x0E0CA000 | 0x1

The remainder of the file is a repeated sequence of the following information. One input may be associated with numerous outputs.

Byte array representation of each input/output(s) pair:

`(#)` is the number of bytes the given information is alloted.

**Input Bytes**
| Input Flags (4) | Input VirtualKey (1) | Padding (3) | Parameter (4) | Outputs Count (1) | Padding (3) | (all outputs for input) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Output Bytes**
| Output Flags (4) | Output VirtualKey (1) | Padding (3) | Output Parameter (4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

There is no count for the number of inputs. Instead the file is read until no further input/output(s) pairings can be read.

#### Flags

The flags indicate information that modifies the value (alt/shift/ctrl and special functionality when mapping to another output)

#### VirtualKey

A [VirtualKey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) value.

#### Parameter

A special value associated with the input/output (as necessary based on the function).

#### Output Count

This is limited to a single byte despite the use of an int, so 255 maximum.

## History

Used to be called Key2Key but then I added mouse support so that name needed to change.
